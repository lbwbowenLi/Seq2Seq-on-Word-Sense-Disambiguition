SemCor 3.0 was automatically created from SemCor 1.6 by mapping 
WordNet 1.6 to WordNet 3.0 senses.
SemCor 1.6 was created and is property of Princeton University.

Some (few) word senses from WordNet 1.6 were dropped, and therefore 
they cannot be retrieved anymore in the 3.0 database. A sense of 0 
(wnsn=0) is used to symbolize a missing sense in WordNet 3.0.

The automatic mapping was performed within the Language and Information 
Technologies lab at UNT, by Rada Mihalcea (rada@cs.unt.edu).

THIS MAPPING IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND UNT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS 
OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT 
LIMITATION, UNT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-
ABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

copies of the database, including modifications that you make for internal  
use or for distribution.  
Both LICENSE and README files distributed with the SemCor 1.6 package
are included in the current distribution of SemCor 3.0.

When the WordNet Semantic Concordance package is unbundled you should
have the following files and subdirectories in this directory:

	README.semcor3.0	this file
	LICENSE			WordNet copyright and license agreement
	INSTALL			INSTALL file for SemCor 1.6 
	brown1		103 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(all content words tagged)
	brown2		83 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(all content words tagged)
	brownv		166 semantically tagged Brown Corpus files
				(only verbs tagged)

Each semantic concordance directory (brown1, brown2, brownv) contains
the following subdirectories:
	tagfiles	directory of semantically tagged files

To access the files, unzip and untar the file semcor3.0.tar.gz.

For other files, such as documentation, taglists, etc., please check

MASC-3.0.0  2012-12-15
----------------------

Full documentation for the MASC data and processing tools is
available at http://www.anc.org/data/masc.

DATA DESCRIPTION
----------------
See http://www.anc.org/data/masc/corpus

CONTENTS
--------

data - 
   spoken - data and annotations for spoken data
   written - data and annotations for written data

   See http://www.anc.org/data/masc/masc-structure for 
   details on the organization of MASC data and annotation files
 
   original-annotations - Contains annotations contributed to MASC in 
        their original format, as prepared by an external annotation 
        project. Versions of these annotations that have been transduced 
        to GrAF XML are included in the data directories. In general, 
        errors in the originals are left uncorrected.

MASC-resource-header.xml - 
   Comprehensive information about the corpus, contents, 
   organization, domain codes, naming conventions, etc.

RELEASE 3.0.0 NOTES
-------------------

Quid Pro Quo
------------

Although every effort has been made to validate MASC annotations, there 
are likely still errors, omissions, and inconsistencies. Because MASC is a 
collaborative community resource, we ask the community to report errors so 
that we can correct them. We will release immediate updates through 
the MASC website at http://www.anc.org/data/masc/downloads/data-download/. 
Periodic updates will also be made available through LDC.

Known Problems
--------------

Penn POS tags

The current Penn POS tags, generated by a modified version of GATE's ANNIE 
Part-of-speech tagger, have not been fully validated. All Penn treebank (ptbtok)
and FrameNet (fntok) POS tags are hand-validated. The remainder of MASC is 
currently being annotated for Penn Treebank syntax, at which point the entire corpus 
will have hand-annotated POS tags.


Penn Treebank Tokens

There remain a few problems with the Penn Treebank tokenizations, 
primarily due to corrections to the texts made by the Treebank project
in the course of generating the original annotations. In some cases,
we have corrected the tokenizations to refer to the faulty text 
segment (e.g., "o" for "off" due to removal of ligatures in the 
course of transduction from original Quark Express files) and added 
an annotation named "corrected" whose value provides the correction to 
the text.


Event co-reference

The original GATE annotations done at Carnegie-Mellon University used the 
annotation set name internal to GATE to group events that co-refer. This information 
is lost once the annotations are output in any other format. The event co-reference 
annotations included in MASC are therefore a subset of those in the originals, and do 
not include the grouping information contained in the annotation set names. The 
differences can be seen by loading both the MASC event annotations and the original 
CMU annotations into GATE. 

Tweets

A few non-English tweets appear in the Twitter files.

The original texts in the MASC are drawn from the Open American National Corpus (OANC), which includes written texts and spoken transcripts of American English produced since 1990. The OANC includes a broad range of genres. MASC data have been selected to include approximately equal-sized representative samples of OANC genres. The data in the MASC are taken "as is" from the Open American National Corpus. OANC data is derived from original electronic versions in a wide variety of formats, including but not limited to Quark Express, XML, Microsoft Word, Portable Document Format (PDF), HTML, and plain text. Transduction procedures vary depending on the original format. As little correction or other editorial modification as possible is applied to the text themselves. Corrections to the text are either made in standoff documents containing the corrected version, or are reflected in values of segmentation, token, sentence, or other segmental unit, and/or part of speech annotation. The data are segmented into minimal regions spanning the primary data. Minimal regions are identified as the smallest unit any of the tokenizations applied to data references. Token annotations reference these regions as appropriate. Sentences reference regions in primary data.
